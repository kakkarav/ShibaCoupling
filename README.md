# ShibaCoupling

The helper module for generating effective couplings between magnetic impurity inside a superconductor in the presence of a transverse magnetic field.

The couplings is given in the Pauli string basis.


# Installation 

The dependencies can be installed by running the following command in the terminal
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# How to use

An example for generating 2-body and 3-body interaction for a square lattice is given in main.py: 
```python
python main.py
```
